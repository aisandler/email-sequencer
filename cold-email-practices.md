If you want your cold email campaigns to
0:01
get good results, you need to know how
0:03
to stand out in your prospects inboxes.
0:05
And I know this because I've sent
0:07
millions of emails. And through hundreds
0:09
of split tests, I found that if your
0:10
reply rate isn't at least 3%, there's
0:13
only five mistakes that you could be
0:14
making. But if you can fix those
0:16
mistakes, your leads will be practically
0:18
forced to read your emails, your reply
0:20
rates will skyrocket, and your calendar
0:22
will fill up way faster. So, in this
0:24
video, I'm going to be breaking down the
0:25
five mistakes holding back your cold
0:26
emails and give you tactical ways on how
0:28
you can fix them forever. So, before we
0:30
dive into these five mistakes, I need to
0:32
reframe how you think about cold emails
0:34
entirely. A cold email has one real job,
0:37
to feel like it was written specifically
0:39
for the person reading it and to get
0:40
that specific person to raise their hand
0:42
and show interest to what you're saying.
0:45
Most people think cold emails are about
0:46
closing a deal. They're not. They're
0:48
about generating direct response
0:50
interest. So, what does a cold email
0:52
actually need to do? First, it needs to
0:54
prove relevance in the first 5 seconds.
0:56
They should think, "This person actually
0:58
knows who I am and what I'm dealing
1:00
with." And second, it needs to answer
1:02
the what's in it for me question
1:04
immediately. Problem number one is the
1:06
spray and prey mistake. And this is
1:08
where people just basically blast the
1:10
same generic message to everyone on a
1:12
big list that they were able to acquire
1:14
instead of segmenting it by industry,
1:16
maybe company size, role, or the actual
1:18
problem that they're probably facing.
1:20
Too many people treat a 10person startup
1:23
the same as a 10,000 person enterprise
1:25
when they're cold email or they pitch
1:27
the exact same thing to a CMO and a VP
1:30
of sales. And the problem with that is
1:32
is that your message isn't relevant to
1:34
anyone because it's trying to be
1:36
relevant to everyone. Here's the fix.
1:38
Segment your list before you write a
1:40
single email. At minimum, you need to
1:42
segment it by company size, industry, of
1:44
course, role. Is it a founder? Is it a
1:46
VP? Is it a CMO? And even maybe
1:48
location. Then what you'll do is you'll
1:50
write a different email for each segment
1:52
that speaks directly to their specific
1:54
problems, goals, and context for that
1:56
specific person. Here's what an email to
1:58
a 10 to 50 person startup could look
2:00
like. Hi, first name. Most founders I
2:02
work with at that 10 to 30 person range
2:04
hit that same wall. Outbound work great
2:06
when the founder did it personally, but
2:08
it completely breaks when you try to
2:09
hand it off. I built a playbook
2:11
specifically for this transition, and
2:13
it's the same thing that we helped
2:14
similar company do to go from five
2:16
replies a week to 30 a day. Could I
2:18
shoot it over? Here's the framework that
2:19
I use before sending any cold email
2:21
campaign. Step one, divide your list
2:22
into three to five segments. You don't
2:24
need to go crazy, but just don't blast
2:26
everyone with the same message. Step
2:28
number two, for each segment, answer
2:30
these four questions. What's the number
2:31
one pain point right now for that
2:33
person? What do they actually care about
2:35
most? Is it speed? Is it scale? Is it
2:36
compliance? Is it cost? What language or
2:39
terminology do they actually use? And
2:41
what proof or value would actually
2:43
resonate with them? Step number three,
2:46
we want to write a different email for
2:48
each segment that speaks directly to
2:50
those answers. Segment first, then
2:52
write. All right. Problem number two is
2:54
what we call the generic opener problem.
2:56
This is when your email starts in one of
2:58
two ways. First, by talking about you,
3:01
your company, what you do, instead of
3:03
immediately addressing something
3:05
relevant to them. Or second, you think
3:06
that you're personalizing just because
3:08
you put their job title or company name,
3:10
but it's painfully obvious that you sent
3:12
the same exact email to 500 people.
3:15
Here's what both these look like and
3:16
what I see all too often. The me first
3:18
could sound something like, "My name is
3:19
Austin. I'm the founder of agency. We
3:21
help agency scale." Or the painful fake
3:24
personalization, which is something
3:25
like, "Hi, first name. As the VP of
3:27
sales at company name, I'm sure you're
3:30
focusing on hitting your revenue goal
3:31
this quarter. I work with VP of sales
3:33
like yourself." No, please stop with
3:36
that. The problem with all of these
3:37
approaches is that nobody cares about
3:39
you yet. And mentioning their job title
3:42
doesn't prove you know anything about
3:43
them specifically. With the first
3:45
approach, you haven't earned the right
3:46
to talk about yourself. With the second
3:48
approach, you can smell the mail emerge
3:50
from a mile away. Mentioning their job
3:51
title proves that you have access to
3:53
LinkedIn. Whoopy freaking do. And bad
3:55
personalization to me is actually worse
3:57
than no personalization at all because
3:59
it proves you actually just don't care
4:01
and you're just sending them a cold
4:02
email. You have 3 seconds to earn the
4:05
right to talk about yourself. And
4:06
starting with me, me me raises signals
4:09
in these people's heads that this is a
4:10
mass email and this is going into my
4:12
deleted folder. Here's the fix. Start
4:14
with them and show you understand their
4:17
specific situation. And especially since
4:19
we segmented the list, this should be
4:20
fairly easy to execute. Your first
4:22
sentence should reference one of two
4:23
things. Something specific about their
4:25
company, a recent announcement, funding,
4:27
product launch, expansion, something
4:29
from their website, a specific challenge
4:30
their company or industry might be
4:31
facing right now. something about their
4:33
tech stack, their strategy or their
4:34
approach. We need to be specific. If you
4:37
cannot say something specific that
4:38
applies to only them, do not pretend to
4:41
personalize. The good opener starts with
4:44
them, and it's specific enough that it
4:46
could only apply to their business or
4:48
their company or what that person in
4:50
that role is dealing with right now.
4:52
Here's the two-part test that I like to
4:54
use. Part one is the them first rule.
4:56
Your prospect's company or situation
4:57
should be mentioned before your company
4:59
is even mentioned. If you talk about
5:00
yourself before you talk about them,
5:02
you've already lost because you're
5:03
irrelevant. Part number two is the only
5:05
them test. Ask yourself, could this
5:07
sentence apply to a thousand other
5:09
companies? If yes, it's too generic. You
5:12
need to rewrite it. And if no, you've
5:14
got a good personalized line. Examples
5:16
that would pass the test is, "Saw you
5:17
just hired three SDRs based off of your
5:19
last LinkedIn post. Notice that you're
5:21
using Salesforce, but there's no
5:22
enrichment in your tech stack." And
5:23
examples that fail are, "As a VP of
5:26
sales, you probably want more pipeline.
5:28
I saw your company wants to grow
5:29
revenue. I saw you posted on LinkedIn
5:31
recently. My name is Austin and I help
5:33
companies like yours. The specific
5:34
formula is a specific observation about
5:37
them. Common problem that they're likely
5:38
to face. And if you nail these two
5:41
things, then you have instant relevance.
5:43
Now, look, real personalization does
5:45
take effort, but that's exactly why it
5:47
works. And here's the thing, you can now
5:49
actually do this at scale. I use a tool
5:52
called Instantly to write personalized
5:53
lines for my entire list. They have a
5:55
built-in AI models, tons of pre-built
5:57
prompts, and you can even create your
5:58
own custom prompts, and it actually will
6:00
pull from the prospect's LinkedIn, their
6:02
summary, their job title, their website,
6:04
all kinds of different data sources. So,
6:06
I can be genuinely relevant to hundreds
6:08
or thousands of people without writing
6:10
each line manually. And doing this pass
6:13
the only them test, and it makes sure
6:14
that my personalization is actually
6:16
relevant. All right, mistake number
6:18
three is what I call the wall of text
6:20
trap. This is when your email is longer
6:22
than 80 words or has paragraphs that are
6:25
more than two to three lines, please.
6:27
And here's what this looks like in
6:29
practice. Hi, Fame. I wanted to reach
6:30
out because I've been following your
6:31
company for a while and I think there's
6:33
a really interesting opportunity for us
6:34
to work together. We specialize in
6:35
helping companies like your skill
6:36
through outbound sales process through a
6:38
combination of technology, strategy, and
6:40
proven frameworks that have worked for
6:42
over 200 companies. I'd love to learn
6:43
more about what you're working on to see
6:44
if there's a fit. Would you maybe be
6:45
open to a conversation sometimes, let's
6:47
say, next week? That's around 89 words
6:49
in one paragraph. Here's the problem.
6:51
Long emails will get immediately
6:53
deleted, especially on mobile where 60%
6:55
of emails are read first. Dense
6:57
paragraphs are even worse. Your
6:58
prospects open your email on their
7:00
phone. They see a huge block of text and
7:02
their brain goes, "I'll read this
7:03
later," aka never. According to
7:05
Boomerang's analysis of millions of
7:07
emails, messages between 50 and 125
7:09
words get the highest response rates,
7:11
about 50% higher than longer emails.
7:14
People aren't reading your emails word
7:15
for word anyway. they're scanning and if
7:17
they can't scan in 3 seconds, they're
7:19
not going to read it at all. So, here's
7:20
the fix. Keep it under 80 words total.
7:23
Use one to two sentences max per
7:26
paragraph. Do something like this. Hi,
7:28
first name. Saw you just launched the
7:30
new product line. Congrats. Most brands
7:31
I work with see a 20 to 30% drop in
7:33
reply rates when they scale to multiple
7:35
products. It's usually a segmentation
7:37
issue. Would it make sense to send over
7:39
the three-step audit that we use to fix
7:40
this? It takes 10 minutes just to
7:42
implement on your end. That's around 50
7:44
words. Short paragraphs and easy to scan
7:46
on mobile. Okay. And here is my process
7:48
for keeping email short. Step one, write
7:50
your email naturally first. Don't worry
7:52
about length. Step number two, read it
7:54
on your phone, pull it up on your email
7:55
app, and look at it. Step number three,
7:57
apply these rules. If any paragraph is
7:59
more than two sentences, break it up. If
8:01
the total email is more than 80 words,
8:03
cut 30%. Remove any word that doesn't
8:05
directly contribute to the core message.
8:08
Step number four is use the drunk test.
8:10
If someone couldn't understand your
8:12
email in 10 seconds while drunk at a
8:13
bar, it's too complicated. Simplify it.
8:15
Here's the formula that I use for that.
8:17
Line one, specific observation about
8:19
them or a personalized line. Line two to
8:21
three, the problem they likely face.
8:23
Line four would be the offer or value
8:26
prop. And line number five would be
8:27
simple call to action, which would be
8:29
offering to add some sort of value to
8:31
them. Total 50 to 80 words max. And one
8:33
more tactical tip, guys, is that every
8:35
paragraph should be scannable on its
8:37
own. Each paragraph should communicate
8:39
one idea. If they only read your first
8:41
line and your last line, would they
8:42
understand what you're actually
8:43
offering? All right, mistake number four
8:44
is what I call the ask for a call offer
8:46
problem. This is when your entire offer
8:48
is, "Can we hop on a 15-minute call? Are
8:50
you free for 15 minutes in the next
8:52
couple of days?" You're basically asking
8:53
them to give you their time, without
8:54
offering them any value in return first.
8:57
The problem with this is that your
8:58
prospect doesn't know you. They don't
8:59
trust you, and they definitely don't
9:01
want another sales call. You're asking
9:02
them to basically spend something, which
9:04
is their time, before they're giving
9:06
anything of value. And when you lead
9:08
with, "Can we hop on a call?" Their
9:10
brain translates to this person wants to
9:12
pitch me and I have no idea who they are
9:14
and if they can even add value to me. So
9:16
the default answer is no, I don't want
9:18
to jump on a call. What you need to do
9:20
is you need to give them a reason to
9:22
jump on a call, a reason for them to be
9:24
interested in even talking to you. So
9:26
here's the fix. We need to lead with
9:27
value, not a calendar invite. Instead of
9:29
asking them for their time, give them
9:31
something valuable first. This could be
9:33
a framework, a playbook, a specific case
9:35
study, an audit, something that people
9:37
would normally need to pay for in order
9:38
to get it. This could look like saying,
9:40
"Hey, I put together a 10-minute audit
9:41
of your current cold email approach, and
9:43
I found three quick wins that could
9:44
boost your reply rates. Is it cool if I
9:46
send it over to you? No call required."
9:48
Make your first offer something that
9:49
they can say yes to in around 10 seconds
9:52
without getting on a call. And once
9:53
they've engaged, once they've seen your
9:55
value, then you can ask for a call and
9:58
they'll actually want to take it because
10:00
the call becomes the natural next step.
10:02
Plus, if they are raising their hand and
10:03
they are interested in what you have to
10:05
offer, that becomes somebody who showed
10:06
intent and somebody you can actually
10:08
follow up with and that becomes to me a
10:11
pretty warm lead. All right, the fifth
10:12
and final mistake is what I call the one
10:13
and done failure. This is when you send
10:15
one email and give up or even worse, you
10:17
send generic just following up emails or
10:20
emails that basically just add zero
10:21
value. I'm talking emails like just
10:23
bumping this up. Hi, still interested in
10:25
chatting. Let me know if this is a
10:27
better time. Hey, just following up one
10:28
more time. These types of emails add
10:30
zero new value and they just remind the
10:32
person that you exist and that you want
10:33
something from them. People are busy and
10:36
if your first email got buried, that
10:37
doesn't mean that they're not
10:39
interested. But lazy follow-ups, they're
10:40
just going to damage your credibility
10:42
even more and make the person more
10:43
likely not to respond to you. Let me
10:45
give you some stats because this one is
10:48
pretty wild. Only 2% of sales happen on
10:50
the first touch point. 80% of sales
10:53
happen between touch point 5 and 12. But
10:56
just 44% of sales people give up after
10:58
just one follow-up. Think about that.
11:00
The vast majority of conversations
11:02
happen in the follow-up, but almost half
11:04
of the people quit after just one email.
11:06
But again, here's the catch. Every just
11:08
checking in email makes you seem more
11:11
desperate and less valuable. Here's the
11:13
fix. Send three to five follow-ups, but
11:15
each one must add new value or you have
11:18
a new angle with the offer that you're
11:20
trying to get them to raise their hand
11:21
for. Every follow-up should be able to
11:23
stand alone as a basically a valuable
11:25
email. Never just a bump or a circle
11:27
back. Follow-ups aren't about reminding
11:28
them that you exist. They're about
11:30
giving them another reason to reply to
11:32
you. A good follow-up sequence could
11:33
look like this. After you send the first
11:35
email, you could say something like,
11:36
"Hi, first name. One more thing. Just
11:37
ran the numbers on similar companies
11:40
campaign. The one thing that drove 90%
11:42
of the results was segmenting by region
11:44
in the first line. Sounds simple, but it
11:46
took their reply rate from 3 to 14%.
11:48
Happy to share the breakdown for you."
11:50
And another angle is the free value.
11:52
Last one for me. First name. the
11:53
timing's off. I totally get it, but
11:54
figured I'd send this over regardless.
11:56
Here's a link to the playbook. It's the
11:58
exact step-by-step process that a
12:00
similar company used that you can
12:02
implement on your own. No call required.
12:03
And if you end up using it and you want
12:04
to chat, I'm around. So, the framework
12:06
that you can use is email one could be
12:09
the value offer where you could offer
12:11
like a case study or playbook or an
12:12
audit of some sort. Email two could be
12:14
additional insight or some data on
12:16
specifically how you've been able to
12:17
help other companies. Email three could
12:19
be the social proof angle with a similar
12:21
company. An email five can just be
12:23
giving them the free resource with no
12:24
strings attached. Most people give up
12:26
too early or follow up too lazily. And
12:28
if you do this right, you will improve
12:30
your reply rate from just the follow-up
12:32
sequence alone. Now, if you want to see
